Hello! I'm Griffin, and I'm an [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) fellow and incoming Ph.D. student studying computer science at the University of Pittsburgh. I work in the [Surreality Lab](https://surreality.pitt.edu) under the leadership of [Dr. Jacob Biehl](https://jtbiehl.github.io/) and [Dr. Edward Andrews](https://www.neurosurgery.pitt.edu/people/edward-andrews) researching spatial computing (AR/VR) in the medical domain. Specifically, my research is at the intersection of spatial computing and human-computer interaction.


As an undergrad, I defended my [Bachelor's of Philosopy (BPhil)](https://www.frederickhonors.pitt.edu/academics/bachelor-philosophy-bphil-degree) thesis, _[Untethered Displays: The Effects of Mixed Reality on Split-Attention in Fine-Motor Tasks](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/46106/)_. I also received the [Chancellor's Undergraduate Teaching Fellowship](https://www.frederickhonors.pitt.edu/research/research-creative-fellowships/chancellors-undergraduate-teaching-fellowships) for Fall 2023 to redesign the curriculum for [CMPINF 0010: Big Ideas in Computing and Information](https://courses.sci.pitt.edu/courses/view/CMPINF-0010) and was a teaching assistant for [a few other computer science courses](/teaching). I also served as the student representative for the School of Computing and Information's Academic Council for the 2022-2023 academic year.

<!-- 
I have also worked with [Dr. Ioannis Zervantonakis' lab](https://www.zervalab.com/) through the [Hillman Academy](https://hillmanacademy.upmc.com/) studying biological image analysis and fibroblast-mediated drug resistance in HER2+ breast cancer. Some of my work from the Zervantonakis lab appeared at the 2021 AMIA National Symposium in their [High School Scholars Program](https://amia.org/education-events/amia-2021-annual-symposium/high-school-scholars). I served as a Resident Assistant for the Hillman Academy in 2023.

Before coming to Pitt, I was named as one of [Junior Achievement of Western Pennsylvania's 18 Under Eighteen](https://www.post-gazette.com/life/goodness/2022/01/28/The-18-Under-Eighteen-Junior-Achievement-of-Western-Pennsylvania-young-people-winners/stories/202201300006) and worked with the [IC4 Project](https://ic4.site/index.html) (now the ABLE Project), where I taught Python to students from all over the world and developed educational technology to streamline virtual learning in computer science. 

I also like to play guitar, piano, and golf.-->
