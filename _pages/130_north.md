Unless you're a PhD student in Pitt SCI or attended certain admitted student day events this summer, you probably haven't been to the shiny, new SCI offices in 130 N Bellefield. Here's some instructions on how to come to my in-person office hours!

##### **Step 1:** Come to the Information Sciences (IS) building, located at 135 N Bellefield Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.

##### **Step 2:** Look across the street from the IS building.

Here's what the main entrance to the offices looks like:

##### **Step 3:** Enter through the main doors and take the elevator to your left up to the fifth floor.

Upon getting off the elevator, you should see this:

(sometimes the TV screens say "Pitt SCI")

##### **Step 4:** If the door isn't open (it usually isn't), ring the doorbell on the whiteboard in between the TV screens.

##### **Step 5:** Attend office hours!

If at any point you get lost trying to come to office hours, send me an email, and I'll do my best to direct you. Hope to see you soon!
