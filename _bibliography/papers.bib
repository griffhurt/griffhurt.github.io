  abstract={Mixed reality (MR) holds potential for transforming endovascular surgery by enhancing information delivery. This advancement could significantly alter surgical interfaces, leading to improved patient outcomes. Our research utilizes MR technology to transform physical monitor displays inside the operating room (OR) into holographic windows. We aim to reduce cognitive load on surgeons by counteracting the split attention effect and enabling ergonomic display layouts. Our research is tackling key design challenges, including hands-free interaction, and occlusion management in densely crowded ORs. We are conducting studies to understand user behavior changes when people consult information on holographic windows compared to conventional displays.}
