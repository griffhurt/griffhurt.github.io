  abstract={Mixed reality (MR) holds potential for transforming endovascular surgery by enhancing information delivery. This advancement could significantly alter surgical interfaces, leading to improved patient outcomes. Our research utilizes MR technology to transform physical monitor displays inside the operating room (OR) into holographic windows. We aim to reduce cognitive load on surgeons by counteracting the split attention effect and enabling ergonomic display layouts. Our research is tackling key design challenges, including hands-free interaction, and occlusion management in densely crowded ORs. We are conducting studies to understand user behavior changes when people consult information on holographic windows compared to conventional displays.},

  abstract={Mixed reality (MR) allows virtual content to be merged with the physical world, enabling novel visualization affordances not available with traditional displays. These affordances are particularly beneficial in the medical domain, as surgeons can view imaging and other relevant patient data in a 3D spatial context. In burn surgery, excision and grafting are mainstay treatments for deep partial and full-thickness burns. However, identifying regions to be excised is nontrivial. Recent work has developed imaging techniques that assist surgeons in determining burn margins. In this study, we demonstrate a new application of MR for burn surgery by building and evaluating a system that overlays deep burn margins onto a simulated anatomical surface for surgeons to trace. This represents a first step towards creating an MR system that can help physicians interpret burn surface area and depth for surgical planning.},
